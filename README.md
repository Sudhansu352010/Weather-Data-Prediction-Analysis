# INSIGHTS
1. Average Humidity is 2043
2. Average barometer reading is 32k
3. Average temp found in the data set is 31.78
4. Average visibility is about 5.72km

# Future Scope
1. Weather data analysis techniques will continue to advance, enabling more accurate weather forecasting. Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms will be leveraged to enhance prediction models, incorporating a wide range of data sources such as satellite imagery, weather station data, radar observations, and climate models. This will result in more precise and reliable weather forecasts, benefiting various sectors like agriculture, transportation, renewable energy, and disaster management.
2. With the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, analyzing their causes, patterns, and impacts becomes crucial. Weather data analysis will play a vital role in understanding and predicting events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, heatwaves, and floods. This knowledge can help in early warning systems, disaster preparedness, and proactive decision-making to mitigate the adverse effects of these events.
3. Climate change is a global challenge that requires a deep understanding of long-term weather patterns and trends. Weather data analysis will contribute to assessing climate change impacts, studying climate variability, and analyzing historical weather records. By examining temperature trends, precipitation patterns, and other climatic variables, scientists can better understand the dynamics of climate change and develop effective strategies for adaptation and mitigation.
